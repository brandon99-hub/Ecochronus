EcoChronos — Full MVP (Frontend + User Flow + Components + Data + API)

This is the version that:

You can build in hours.

You can demo confidently.

Works on Replit with almost no config.

Has no uploads, no storage, no complicated logic.

✅ 1. MVP GOAL

Let a user:

Create an account

Log in

View eco missions

Start a mission

Complete a mission by submitting a simple text-based “evidence” form

Earn points

View their total points and completed missions count

That's the entire MVP loop.

✅ 2. FRONTEND SCREENS (4 TOTAL)
Screen 1 — Authentication (Login & Signup)

Route: /auth
Features:

Email

Password

Toggle “Have an account? Log in / Sign up”

On success: store JWT → redirect to dashboard

API:

POST /auth/register

POST /auth/login

Screen 2 — Dashboard (Mission List + Quick Stats)

Route: /dashboard
Shows:

User points: Total Points: X

Completed missions: Completed: Y

Mission List with each mission:

title

description

points

status: AVAILABLE / ACTIVE / COMPLETED

Action buttons:

AVAILABLE → Start

ACTIVE → Complete

COMPLETED → disabled

API:

GET /missions

GET /user/stats

POST /missions/{id}/start

Screen 3 — Mission Detail

Route: /mission/:id

Shows:

title

description

points

“Start Mission” button (if not started)

“Complete Mission” button (if active)

“Already Completed” status

This screen is optional but good UX.
If you want, you can skip it to simplify routing.

Screen 4 — Mission Completion Form

Route: /mission/:id/complete

Fields:

Textarea: “What did you do?” (required)

Dropdown: Activity Type (optional)

Cleanup

Tree Planting

Recycling

Energy Saving

Number input: Quantity (optional)

Button: Submit Completion

API:
POST /missions/{id}/complete
Payload:

{
  "description": "Collected 2kg of plastic waste in the estate.",
  "category": "Recycling",
  "quantity": 2
}


On success:

redirect to dashboard

stats update automatically

✅ 3. FRONTEND COMPONENTS (MINIMAL SET)
/src/components/

AuthForm.tsx

MissionCard.tsx

Navbar.tsx (very basic)

/src/pages/

AuthPage.tsx

Dashboard.tsx

MissionPage.tsx

CompleteMissionPage.tsx

/src/api/

client.ts — fetch wrapper (inject JWT)

auth.ts

missions.ts

user.ts

✅ 4. API ENDPOINTS (FULL MVP LIST)
Authentication

POST /auth/register

POST /auth/login

Missions

GET /missions

POST /missions/:id/start

POST /missions/:id/complete

User

GET /user/stats

✅ 5. MINIMAL DATA FLOW
Login Flow

User enters email/pass

API returns { token }

Store token in localStorage

Redirect → /dashboard

Dashboard Flow

Fetch /user/stats

Fetch /missions

Render everything

If user clicks:

Start → call /missions/{id}/start

Complete → redirect to /mission/{id}/complete

Mission Completion Flow

User fills form

Submit → /missions/{id}/complete

Backend:

Marks mission complete

Adds points

Redirect → /dashboard

✅ 6. MVP FRONTEND BEHAVIOR RULES

If token missing, redirect user to /auth.

If API returns 401, clear token → redirect to /auth.

Keep UI dead simple: lists, buttons, forms.

No file uploads, no images, no animations.

Use only useState and useEffect.

Tailwind optional — plain CSS is fine.
